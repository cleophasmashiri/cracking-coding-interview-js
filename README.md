# cracking-coding-interview-js

Cracking-coding-interview-js is my take series on [Cracking Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850) using vanilla javascript. This book is good coding practice, for up-skilling a developer's coding muscles.


To run any of the examples: cd in the directory containing filename.js for example and run command below.

```
node filename.js
```
